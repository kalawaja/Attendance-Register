### About My Course

* I attended the PHP Backend Web Developer Course, which was prepared in partnership with [Institute Istanbul ISMEK](https://enstitu.ibb.istanbul/portal/default.aspx) and [Technology and Human Association](https://www.tekinder.org.tr/).
* In this course, which was prepared with great efforts under the leadership of my trainer [Mehmet SelÃ§uk Batal](https://github.com/msbatal), the last stage, the Project stage, was passed.
* I chose the 1st PHP Backend Web Developer Project Topics: This project is called "Phone Book". It is a project that is essentially an "Attendance Register".
* I have finished this project.
* This repo has been opened for the Institute Istanbul ISMEK Backend Web Developer Training Program ("Project Stage").

* Basically, the detailed project of which belongs to you;
When visitors log in to the directory page, they will encounter a form and register their name, surname and phone number in the system.
Administrators, on the other hand, will be able to see, edit, delete these records added on a page they log in with a password, and add new records from there (admin panel).
